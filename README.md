# classifyFileFormat
Classify files within the folder and move those as per file extension, category, date etc.

This project was initiated to solve my real life problem, whenever I need to move my IPhone's data to specific folder it takes a lot of time so created this to automate movement of my files (with extention .jpg, .jpeg, .mp4, .xlsx, .pdf and more) to the given folder/categories (i.e. Image, Video, PDF, and other Iphone formats).

Thanks, Vijay Bhandari
